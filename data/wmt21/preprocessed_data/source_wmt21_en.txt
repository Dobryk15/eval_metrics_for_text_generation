Couple MACED at California dog park for not wearing face masks while having lunch (VIDEO) - RT USA News
There's mask-shaming and then there's full on assault.
A California couple having lunch with their puppy at a dog park experienced the second, when an irate woman pepper-sprayed them for refusing to mask up... while eating.
Ash O'Brien and husband Jarett Kelley say they were grabbing a bite to eat at Dusty Rhodes dog park in San Diego on Thursday, with their three-month-old pug in tow.
The pair had their masks off to eat, when a "random old lady" approached, calling them "idiots" for not masking up, even though "you can't wear a mask and eat at the same time."
O'Brien told the woman to leave the park and stop harassing her, at which point the woman unleashed a can of mace at the couple.
Video footage captured by a bystander begins with Kelley wrestling the spray can from the woman, and getting a dose of mace into the face for his troubles.
O'Brien can be heard crying in the background as the attacker walks away with her dogs.
O'Brien shared the video on Facebook and told ABC 10 that she wants to see the woman "go to jail."
Face masks are mandatory across the state of California, even in fresh air.
These masks can only be removed at a select few times, including when eating or drinking.
However, nowhere in the state's coronavirus guidelines does it say that bystanders may use non-lethal weapons to enforce this policy.
Even in the current era of "mask-shaming," that's still a crime carrying a penalty of a fine of $1000 or up to three years in a state prison.
Seattle Protests: Fires and Pepper Spray as Thousands March Through City
SEATTLE - After weeks of escalating confrontations between protesters and federal authorities in Portland, Ore., a crowd of about 2000 people mobilized in Seattle on Saturday, marching through the streets and clashing with the police.
Three police officers were injured, including one who was hospitalized with a leg injury caused by an explosive, and 16 protesters were arrested as of early evening, the police said.
Carrying signs such as "Feds Go Home" and shouting chants of "No justice, no peace," the protesters stopped at the site of a future youth detention center and lit buildings there on fire. Some smashed windows of nearby businesses.
The police confronted the crowd in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, deploying flash grenades and pepper spray before they began taking people into custody.
Bipasha Mukherjee, 52, of Kirkland, Wash., said she has been protesting on the streets since May and said it was worrisome to her to see such aggressive tactics by the police.
"This is not the country I immigrated to," said Ms. Mukherjee, who arrived from India more than 30 years ago. "It feels like we are rapidly becoming a fascist state and a police state."
Michaud Savage of Seattle said the protests were aimed at both local authorities and the deployment of federal officers who have waged a crackdown against a long-running protest in Portland. Mr. Savage said the law enforcement tactics in Portland, which have included the use of tear gas and crowd-control munitions, were dangerous and inappropriate.
"It's a very hard slide in an extremely violent direction," Mr. Savage said as he washed his eyes of pepper spray and nursed a wound on his arm from a flash grenade.
The death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May ignited mass protests that drew millions to the streets in dozens of cities, but those demonstrations have waned in most cities.
Seattle and Portland, however, have seen extended demonstrations. Seattle protesters at one point laid claim to several blocks of the Capitol Hill neighborhood and declared an autonomous zone. After a series of shootings there led the police to clear the area, protests had subsided.
Portland, meanwhile, has continued protesting, with some of the heaviest protests around federal buildings in the city. After President Trump issued an executive order to protect statues and federal property, the Department of Homeland Security deployed tactical teams to the city, beginning a series of clashes that have resulted in injured protesters, inspector general investigations and calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave.
Protest crowds in that city have swelled into the thousands, and demonstrations there were continuing. This week, federal officials deployed a tactical team to Seattle, and protesters cited that development as one reason for Saturday's demonstrations.
While the Portland protests have centered in downtown, the demonstrations on Saturday roamed areas east of the downtown core, where the city's federal courthouse is.
Dominic Cummings is held hostage by the SAS... <v>on base tour</v>
PM's chief adviser underwent the experience last week during a tour of the base
The idea of Dominic Cummings being held hostage with rifles pointed at his head might be one for some harassed civil servants to secretly savour.
But the Prime Minister's uncompromising chief adviser underwent just this experience last week during a tour of the SAS headquarters, Stirling Lines.
The Mail on Sunday can reveal that part of his visit on Wednesday involved a trip to the "Killing House" where elite soldiers hone their skills on tackling terrorists.
The guided tour of the Hereford base also included an inspection of the regiment's military hardware and a briefing on recent operations, including efforts to eliminate Islamic State terrorists in Iraq.
High-profile visitors to Stirling Lines are offered an unusual welcome - a turn in the "Killing House," a two-storey building where the SAS practise close-quarter fighting.
Previous guests include Princess Diana, whose hair caught fire thanks to a spark from a grenade thrown during an exercise in 1983.
It is understood that Mr Cummings arrived at the base - named in honour of the regiment's founder, Colonel David Stirling - by helicopter.
He also visited the neighbouring Pontrilas Army Training Area where other top-secret units are based.
The visit was part of his tour of Britain's highly classified UK security installations that has raised eyebrows among politicians and military chiefs.
When news of his plans emerged earlier this month, Tobias Ellwood, a Tory backbencher and chair of the Commons Select Defence Committe, said MPs should be given the same opportunity to question him about defence and security matters as they are afforded for Ministers and civil servants.
Special advisers, who are appointed by politicians, are rarely required to give evidence to select committees.
It is understood that senior SAS officers used Wednesday's event to stress the importance of maintaining the number of personnel in the Royal Marines and the Parachute Regiment.
It has been reported that these units, which provide the majority of Special Forces troops, could shrink or be merged to save money.
"More than half the soldiers in the 250-man SAS were previously Paras while the even smaller Special Boat Service (SBS) couldn't continue without the support of the Royal Marines," said a defence source.
"So Cummings was told that these units must be preserved in their entirety."
Mr Cummings, who has complained that military procurement "has continued to squander billions of pounds," recently attended meetings at the headquarters of MI5 and MI6 and is also planning to visit the SBS's headquarters in Poole, Dorset, along with the Government's top secret laboratories at Porton Down in Wiltshire.
Last night, the Ministry of Defence did not respond to a request for comment.
Man found with gunshot wounds in Mambourin near Werribee
A man has been rushed to hospital after being shot in Melbourne's west overnight.
Police were called to Mambourin, near Werribee, about 8pm where they found a man aged in his 20s with suspected gunshot wounds to the lower body in Yard St.
The man was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
Police said the investigation was ongoing.
Safari park baboons seen armed with knives, screwdrivers and CHAINSAW as 'pranksters give them weapons to wreck cars'
The primates at Knowsley safari park, Merseyside, are long known to pounce on anyone pausing in the enclosure and ripping off a windscreen wiper or mirror.
Baboons have been armed with knives, screwdrivers and even chainsaws at Knowsley safari park, Merseyside.
Workers fear pranksters are arming the pesky primates, who are known to pounce on anyone who pauses and rip off windscreen wipers and mirrors.
Workers now fear they are being armed with the lethal weapons "for a laugh" by visitors to bolster their attacks and the apes have even been seen rummaging around toolboxes themselves.
One park worker told The Sunday Times: "We're not sure if they are being given weapons by some of the guests who want to see them attack cars, or if they're fishing them out of pick-up trucks and vans."
"They will literally go into people's toolboxes and carry them around. One of the baboons was seen lugging around a chainsaw."
Another worker said: "The baboons have been found with knives and screwdrivers. I do wonder if it's some of the guests handing them out."
And the baboon attacks are so inevitable that mechanics across the northwest of England have come to know the enclosure well.
One mechanic in Sale, Greater Manchester said people know what to expect at the park and that he has had two customers fall victim to the baboons this year.
They added that one minute kids want monkeys on the car and the next it has no registration plate - but the issue provides "good money" for the garage.
Knowsley reopened on June 15 with Covid-19 security measures after insisting it was as safe as a McDonald's drive-through as visitors do not leave their car on the five mile safari drive.
The 550-acre park, home to lions, tigers, rhinos, wildebeest and camels, dismissed reports of armed apes as an urban myth.
A spokesperson said: "We believe many of these stories have grown in exaggeration as they've been retold, with embellishment to make the objects that are sometimes found in the enclosure seem more exciting and unbelievable."
In 2012 car manufacturer Hyundai let 40 monkeys from the park loose on its New Generation i30 model for 10 hours to prove it had the strength for families with small children.
US "failures" are holding back search for coronavirus drugs
The global effort to produce useful anti-Covid medicines is being hampered by the US because researchers are testing drugs in "an arbitrary, willy-nilly way," the expert leading the UK's programme has warned.
Britain's Recovery Trial programme, which has involved 12000 patients at several hundred British hospitals, has already pinpointed one promising new drug to tackle the disease and also highlighted two others - previously thought to be potential life-savers - as being useless.
But the failure of the US medical system to match this output has meant that other promising treatments that could have been cleared for widespread use have still to be evaluated.
In particular, convalescent plasma (blood plasma that is taken from Covid-19 patients and which contains antibodies that could protect others against the disease) has still to be properly tested on a large-scale randomised trial.
"Tens of thousands of people have already been given convalescent plasma in the US but these treatments were not randomised," said Professor Martin Landray, one of the founders of the Recovery programme.
"They just give individuals convalescent plasma in the hope it will work. Vast quantities have been given and they still have no idea whether it helps or harms or has no impact," added Landray, an expert in the setting up of large-scale drug trials.
The US is failing to do large, randomised trials and that ends up providing bad medicine
Randomised drug trials are the gold standard for pinpointing useful medicines.
They remove unconscious biases that might cloud clinicians' judgments.
Thousands of people are given a drug and thousands of others are given a placebo.
No one knows which they have been given.
Then results are compared and the efficacy of the treatment revealed.
In this way, Recovery was able to demonstrate that the steroid dexamethasone reduced deaths by a third in Covid-19 patients on ventilators.
It also showed that the much-hyped drug hydroxychloroquine - as well as the combined therapy of the drugs lopinavir and ritonavir - had no effect in saving patients' lives.
Crucially these trials needed very large numbers of patients and no single hospital has enough for such research.
Britain has had one key advantage - a centralised National Health Service.
By contrast, the US health service is fragmented and its only success in pointing a possible treatment has been highlighting the usefulness of the highly expensive drug remdesivir for speeding recovery of some Covid-19 patients.
"There are lots and lots of small drugs trials involving a few dozen or a few hundred patients going on in the US but nothing of any substance," added Landray.
"They are failing to do large, randomised trials and that ends up providing bad medicine. It makes the practice of medicine poorer and the outcomes for patients poorer."
Landray said this failure was particularly exasperating when it came to the use of convalescent plasma, which many doctors believe could have a key role to play in treating seriously ill Covid-19 patients.
"If you look at the US, huge quantities of this treatment have been used on an arbitrary willy-nilly basis. The UK excels beyond measure compared with what's going on there," he added.
Professor Peter Horby, an expert on infectious diseases and the other founder of the Recovery programme, said:
"There have been reports of 20000 patients getting convalescent plasma in a cohort but none of those patients were randomised. If they had put these patients into randomised trials, we would now have a clear answer about the effectiveness of convalescent plasma."
Horby added that UK Recovery has now launched a randomised trial of convalescent plasma but does not expect results to be ready until later this year.
Gwyneth Paltrow wants kids to have good 'worth ethic'
Gwyneth Paltrow has said she wants to raise her children to have a good worth ethic as she tries 'not to just hand them things'.
Paltrow has two children, Apple (16) and Moses (14), with ex-husband Chris Martin and she wants them to have good values and not get by on their parents fame.
"That's why I think it's so important... To raise a kid that has a work ethic and whose values are aligned with yours or with their own sense of who they are, etc," she told Rob Lowe on his podcast.
"The truth of the matter is the doors can be opened for you, but if you think about all the people who try and it doesn't happen."
She added, "As a parent you think, all I can do for these kids is teach them right from wrong and teach them what work is. I've really have tried not to just hand them things."
Paltrow has also taken steps to allow her children to live as privately as possible, and ensures they keep their social media accounts private.
"I won't let them be public on any social media or anything like that, I try to keep them out of the public eye as much as possible," she said.
"You know, now it's different, 'cause kids are like, 'Can I have a YouTube channel?' and I'm like, 'No, you can't. Absolutely not."
Paul Pogba drops hint over his future after Man Utd seal Champions League spot
Manchester United star Paul Pogba has suggested he will stay at the club this summer after the Red Devils sealed a place in the top four.
A 2-0 win against Leicester meant United finished in third, ahead of Frank Lampard's Chelsea.
United were 14 points off Leicester just 12 matches ago but a sensational run of form saw the Red Devils finish in the top four.
Pogba had been expected to leave the club this summer after twice requesting to leave in the last two years.
However, the pandemic means few clubs will be spending big this summer and there's not a buyer available that could combine a transfer fee and Pogba's salary to entice him away from Old Trafford.
That clarification has helped Pogba in recent weeks as his performances, as well as his body language, have improved.
And the Frenchman has dropped the latest hint that he's set to stay at the club by posting on his Instagram after his side's 2-0 win.
While Pogba may have been simply celebrating the club's return to the competition, many fans are interpreting it as a strong suggestion that he'll still be at the club as they compete with Europe's best again.
Pogba has a year to run on his existing deal, though the club can extend that by 12 months meaning he effectively has two years to run.
United are keen on extending Pogba's deal and they want clarity over his situation before next season.
Pogba, for his part, feels comfortable at the club and has been buoyed by the arrival of Bruno Fernandes.
The Portuguese playmaker has been a revelation at Old Trafford and his arrival has allowed Pogba to play in a deeper central midfield position, which has also improved his mood.

Coronavirus: Travellers from Spain told to quarantine
Travellers arriving in the UK from Spain must now quarantine for 14 days, under new coronavirus travel rules.
They were announced on Saturday following a spike in coronavirus cases in Spain, with more than 900 new cases of the virus reported on Friday.
Spanish officials have also warned a second wave could be imminent as major cities have seen cases surge.
Airlines including British Airways have criticised the new measures as "yet another blow" to British holidaymakers.
People currently on holiday in Spain have been advised by the Department of Transport to follow the local rules, return home as normal, and check the Foreign Office's travel advice website for further information.
The Foreign Office is advising against all but essential travel to mainland Spain, however the quarantine measures apply to those returning from mainland Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, such as Majorca and Ibiza.
Foreign Office advice has ramifications for travel insurance.
Among those affected by the new rules is Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who began his holiday in Spain on Saturday.
He is expected to continue his trip as planned and isolate in line with guidance on his return.
Quarantine measures for UK travellers were first introduced in early June.
But after pressure from the aviation and travel industries, the government and devolved administrations published lists of countries exempt from the rules.
British Airways said it was "disappointed" about the latest changes to the government's travel advice and rules, although the airline said its flights were continuing to operate.
It said the move was "throwing thousands of Britons' travel plans into chaos."
The Airport Operators Association said the new measures would "further damage what is already a fragile restart of the aviation sector which continues to face the biggest challenge in its history."
The UK's biggest tour operator, Tui, cancelled its flights due to depart to mainland Spain and the Canary Islands on Sunday.
Customers currently on holiday will be able to return on their intended flight home.
However, budget airline EasyJet said it was "disappointed" and would operate a full schedule in the coming days.
"Customers who no longer wish to travel can transfer their flights without a change fee or receive a voucher for the value of the booking," the company said in a statement.
A spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said the government's quarantine rule change was "disappointing."
"We suggest the government considers lifting the quarantine rules for flights to and from certain regions with lower infection rates, or to places such as the Balearic Islands or the Canaries - which are geographically distinct from mainland Spain - to avoid further damage to the UK inbound and outbound tourism industries," he said.
Spain has so far seen more than 28000 coronavirus deaths.
On Thursday, it saw the biggest daily increase in infections since its lockdown ended.
Catalonia has become the latest region to crack down on nightlife.
The wealthy north-east region, which is home to Barcelona, ordered all nightclubs to close for two weeks and put a midnight curfew on bars in the greater Barcelona area.
The BBC's Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid says contagion among young people is a particular worry, as they have been gathering in large numbers in cities at night.
France has warned its citizens not to travel to Catalonia while Norway has said it will start quarantining people arriving from Spain.
The government is urging employers to be "understanding of those returning from Spain who now will need to self-isolate."
But Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called for the government to explain in detail how it would support those affected, adding that the news would be "deeply concerning for families who are in caught in Spain or are planning travel."
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the decision was made after reviewing the latest data earlier on Saturday.
"This reinforces the point that these matters are subject to change at short notice and so my advice is to be cautious about non-essential foreign travel," she said.
John Blackmore, from Hampshire, was due to fly out to his family in Spain with his wife and two young children.
But the new rules mean he has had to cancel, for fears his wife's employer would not be able to accommodate her taking an extra two weeks off to quarantine on their return.
He said he thought it was unlikely they would get a refund for the flight, as it has not been cancelled.
"I'm devastated," he told the BBC.
"I have family in Spain who haven't seen their only grandkids since Christmas."
Lois Stothard, from South Yorkshire, told the BBC she had booked a holiday to Seville as a surprise for her boyfriend's 30th birthday - due to fly out on Sunday morning - but now feels that she cannot travel.
"I'm a keyworker - I'm a teacher - and my boyfriend has work commitments so we cannot quarantine for 14 days when we return," she said.
"We can't get any money back and to change the company want double what I've already paid in fees. I'm very disappointed and upset as we're packed and ready to go."
Tunisia interior minister named new PM, to form government in a month
Tunisia's Interior Minister Hichem Mechichi has been appointed to form the next government, the president's office said, amid political tensions among major parties in the North African country.
The 46-year-old lawyer succeeds Elyes Fakhfakh, who resigned as prime minister earlier this month.
But Mechichi was not one of the names proposed by the governing political parties to President Kais Saied.
In a statement following Saturday's announcement, Mechichi said he would "work to form a government that meets the expectations of all Tunisians."
Tunisia has been praised as a rare success story for democratic transition after the Arab Spring regional uprisings sparked by its 2011 revolution.
But its leaders have struggled to meet the expectations of the Tunisian people and the already fragile economy has been battered by the closure of the country's borders because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The disease has killed nearly 50 people and infected more than 1400 in Tunisia.
As well as being the interior minister in the outgoing government, Mechichi has been a counsellor to President Saied, handling legal matters.
He has previously been chief of staff at the Ministry of Transport and also served in the Ministry of Social Affairs.
He now has a month to form a government, which will then face a parliamentary vote of confidence and will need an absolute majority to succeed.
Failing that, parliament will be dissolved and new elections will be held within three months.
In the last elections held in October, the Ennahdha party came on top but fell far short of a majority and eventually agreed to join a coalition government.
Fakhfakh's resignation on July 15, after less than five months in office, threatened fresh political deadlock in the nation as it struggles with the economic fallout of the pandemic.
The resignation deepened the political dispute with Ennahdha over allegations against Fakhfakh of conflicts of interest.
Relations between the 47-year-old outgoing leader and Ennahdha have been strained since the October legislative elections.
Fakhfakh stepped down the same day the party filed a no-confidence motion against him.
Ennahdha had initially nominated an independent for prime minister, but he failed to win the support of parliament, leading the president to name former Finance Minister Fakhfakh for the post.
Faced with the prospect of fresh elections, Ennahdha eventually agreed to join the coalition government.
AP blasts White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany for "political" briefings - but reporters keep asking political questions - RT USA News
The Associated Press has accused White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany of worrying the media by making her briefings political rather than informational -- apparently forgetting that reporters choose the questions.
An article Saturday by the AP, the largest US news agency, said White House press briefings may be a "broken tradition," as McEnany has made them "a streamlined, full-throated advertisement for a president facing re-election, a venue for attacks on the media and a forum relatively light on information" about what the government is doing.
The last of those assertions is indisputable, as hardly any new information is revealed at the briefings.
What the AP failed to mention is that hardly any new information is actually sought at the briefings.
Reporters frequently use White House pressers to draw attention to themselves, an art form perfected by CNN's Jim Acosta.
They go beyond the typical adversarial media-administration relationship, repeating each other in asking gotcha questions aimed only at impugning President Donald Trump.
In some cases, they make themselves the news, such as when CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang responded to an "ask China" retort from Trump by making a not-so-subtle hint at racism: "Sir, why are you saying that to me specifically?"
A July 6 briefing offered a prime example of the disconnect over how the briefings have ceased to be a source of meaningful information for Americans.
Trump tweeted that morning that NASCAR's television ratings had been hurt by a false allegation of a hate crime against driver Bubba Wallace and by its decision to ban display of the Confederate flag at its events.
Predictably, most of the questions were about the tweet as reporter after reporter asked McEnany questions designed to prompt her to say that Trump supports the Confederate flag.
McEnany didn't provide the answer reporters wanted - a sound bite that would hurt Trump - but she repeatedly responded by saying the president wasn't taking a position on the Confederate flag and that the gist of his message was that NASCAR fans were wrongly being portrayed as being racist.
The AP said she sounded "exasperated" during the briefing.
The AP's story echoed a Washington Post op-ed column earlier this month by ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl, who also is president of the White House Correspondents Association.
Karl argued, "denying reality and using the White House podium for purely political purposes is a violation of public trust."
Yet McEnany's quick wit and combative style have made her a hero of some Trump supporters, since she gave her first briefing on May 1 after taking over as press secretary in April.
The pressers had been absent for more than a year before her appointment.
Like other aspects of political life in Washington, the White House press secretary's relationship with the media has changed dramatically in the Trump era.
That change has come from both sides and predated McEnany's arrival.
A roast of former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders by comedian Michelle Wolf at the White House Correspondents" dinner in April 2018 was so vicious that even MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski called it "deplorable."
AP White House reporter Jill Colvin greeted McEnany at her first briefing by asking, "Will you pledge never to lie to us from that podium?"
Fox News political analyst Brit Hume, a veteran of more than 50 years in journalism who had a 1989-1996 stint as ABC's chief White House correspondent, said reporters today display "aggressive behavior" in the briefing room because of their contempt for Trump.
It is because of their anti-Trump focus, he said this week on Fox's Tucker Carlson Tonight program, journalists are neglecting to gather policy news.
"It's not just a gotcha game," Hume said of the intended purpose of the pressers.
"It's not just an attempt to embarrass a public official. It's to extract information.
Famously clear Lake Tahoe has been polluted by climate change
South Lake Tahoe, California - Despite the pandemic, even on a weekday, people still crowd Pope Beach at Lake Tahoe.
"I like camping and having a bike ride and going swimming at the Lake," said one girl named Dakota.
"This is something beautiful everybody wants to visit," said Emerica Benitas.
Which is why Matt Meunier's dive business is still going strong, even in a pandemic.
He says he sees "exceptional clarity. Lake Tahoe is the cleanest, most wonderful lake, I think, in the country."
Now the bad news: Lake Tahoe's not as clean, not as clear, as it used to be when he moved here over two decades ago.
"The thing that we're noticing more and more is down on the rocks," Meunier said.
"You're getting this strange algae on the rocks."
Climate change, scientists believe, has affected the water temperature and thus, the clarity.
And 15 million people visit the lake annually - along with the garbage they leave.
Meunier said dive trips to clean up the bottom of the lake found old trash.
"And when I say old trash, I mean '60s, '70s," Meunier said.
"Beer cans, soda cans, church key cans from the old days."
Scientists monitor the clarity of Lake Tahoe every year by dropping a white disc, then measuring how far down they can see it.
UC Davis professor Geoff Schladow said it's an "important indicator of how healthy the lake is."
When it was measured last year, the clarity of the lake was about 80 feet.
That means you can see that disc 80 feet down.
But, consider this, about 20 years ago, the clarity of lake was 100 feet.
That's the trend scientists are trying to reverse.
But they're fighting the impacts of climate change, development around the lake and something added to the lake in the 1960's: A tiny invasive shrimp brought in to feed the fish.
It didn't work.
"Once the shrimp came in, there were suddenly no natural cleaners in the lake," Schladow said.
Similar challenges are facing lakes and bodies of water around the world.
"The lesson here is, if you can't do it at Tahoe, then what hope is there for all the rivers and estuaries, streams and lakes around the country that are never going to have the same degree of attention, the same level of resources?" Schladow said.
Meunier said he is "hopeful" because "if there's a silver lining of our pandemic, I think it showed that nature will come back and heal itself if we just relieved that pressure, that human pressure, off of it and allow it to happen. There's facts there now."
Kudlow says next coronavirus stimulus bill will include more checks, extend moratorium on evictions
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow promised on Sunday that the federal government will extend the moratorium on evictions and send out another round of checks as part of the next coronavirus stimulus package.
Kudlow's comments come after a week where the White House's hoped for payroll tax cuts were shot down by Congress.
"There's a $1200 check coming. That is going to be part of the new package. I would have preferred a payroll tax cut, on top of that check," Kudlow said on CNN's "State of the Union.
"But, be that as it may, politically, it doesn't work."
While no deal has been officially announced, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have been on Capitol Hill recently to discuss the details of a new relief package with congressional leaders.
On ending the additional $600 in unemployment benefits the federal government was supplying, Kudlow argued that the extra money was hurting small businesses from hiring workers.
"We have had a flood of inquiries and phone calls and complaints that small stores and businesses, restaurants can't hire people back," he said.
"They went too far. Maybe last March, it was necessary for that, but, really, there are consequences of people not returning to work."
Mnuchin earlier in the day on "Fox News Sunday" said it a little more bluntly: "I think workers and Americans understand the concept that you shouldn't be paid more to stay home than to work."
Mnuchin said the new bill will provide additional unemployment benefits, but noted that it will be less than the payments issued under the CARES Act.
He said some workers were collecting more than they earned on the job.
As a result, when businesses were reopening some employees did not have an incentive to return to work.
The secretary said the Trump administration and Senate Republicans are on the same page with a $1 trillion package, but noted that in the interest of passing a bill quickly, issues that are more difficult to negotiate with Democrats could be held off for another bill.
Salmonella outbreak sickens 212 people in 23 states
July 25 (UPI) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating an outbreak of salmonella that has sickened 212 people in 23 states.
In a Friday press release the CDC reported that 87 people had become ill since its last update on the outbreak Tuesday.
The agency said people began showing symptoms linked to a strain of salmonella, which can take two to four weeks to manifest symptoms, between June 19 and July 11.
Thirty-one people have been hospitalized since the outbreak began, but no fatalities have been reported.
According to the CDC, a specific source for the salmonella strain has not been identified.
It has not issued any advisement against eating or consuming particular foods, nor named retailers that might be selling contaminated products.
Oregon has had the most cases of salmonella, with 51 infections, with Utah following close behind with 40 reported cases.
Salmonella is a bacterial, foodborne illness that causes 1.35 million infections, 26500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths each year, according to the CDC.
The most common symptoms of salmonella infection are diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps, which can begin between six hours and six days after exposure.
The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment, but some cases require hospitalization.
Algeria: Mahmoud Guemama's Death - Algeria Loses a Patriot, Committed Militant, Says President Tebboune.
Algiers - President of the Republic, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, sent a message of condolences to members of the People's National Assembly (APN), Mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, who died Friday, in which he said that Algeria "has lost a patriot and a militant committed to the causes of his people and his nation."
Algeria loses today, by the death of Mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, a patriot and a militant committed to the causes of his people and his nation, a man who has never wavered and whose determination remained intact from the moment he took up arms, alongside his valiant Mujahedeen brothers, until his last breath on this sad day when we can only resign ourselves to God's will," President Tebboune wrote in his message of condolence.
"The late Mahmoud Guemama, peace be upon him, belonged to a unique generation of faithful patriotic militants who sacrificed themselves for their homeland," added President of the Republic.
"The deceased devoted his life to the liberation of Algeria from the torments of abject colonialism, by joining the ranks of the Revolution in the prime of life in 1960 in the Tahart training camp of the historic wilaya VI."
"The late President is known to all for his proven militancy and his commitment to anchoring the image of a prosperous and united Algeria," said President Tebboune.
"In the far south, the late Mahmoud Guemama enjoys great renown as a mediator, intervening to reconcile brothers in the same country whenever the fire of discord is kindled," added the President in his message.
"All these qualities and values earned the late Mahmoud Guemama the respect and trust of the people of Tamanrasset who chose him to represent them in the People's National Assembly (APN) for several terms, during which he was the ambassador and defender of the concerns of the region and the aspirations of its people, and even the representative and spokesman of all Algerians," wrote the President of the Republic.
"All expressions of condolence will not be enough to pay tribute to the mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, peace be upon him.
He is leaving us today at a time when Algeria needs him," said the President.
"I pray to Almighty God to surround the deceased with His Holy Mercy, to welcome him in His vast paradise alongside the shuhadaa and virtuous.
I also pray to God to lend his family and loved ones patience and comfort...there is no strength or power except in God," the President of the Republic concluded.
Barcelona 'have whole side to sell' this summer as Coutinho, Dembele, Rakitic and Vidal all listed for transfers
BARCELONA will be known as a selling club this summer, according to reports.
No fewer than 12 first team stars have been transfer-listed by the La Liga giants, claim Marca.
Philippe Coutinho has been reportedly transfer-listed by Barcelona
And those include Premier League targets Philippe Coutinho, Ousmane Dembele, Ivan Rakitic and Samuel Umtiti.
Coutinho and Umtiti have both been linked with moves to Arsenal, with the Brazilian also being eyed up by Chelsea.
While Manchester United and Tottenham are said to be in a battle for Rakitic's services.
French World Cup winner Dembele, who has struggled for game time at the Camp Nou, was recently linked with a move to PSG in a swap deal with Neymar.
The other players who are deemed surplus to requirements include Neto, Nelson Semedo, Junior Firpo, Arturo Vidal, Martin Braithwaite, Carles Alena, Rafinha Alcantara, and Jean-Clair Todibo.
Barcelona are hoping a clear out will not only boost their finances, but aid their future transfer business.
Ousmane Dembele is also said to be surplus to requirements
According to the Spanish newspaper, Barcelona have already identified their transfer targets for next season - with Argentinian forward Lautaro Martinez top of their hit list.
But Inter Milan are continuing to ask for his £101million release clause to be met before negotiating with the Catalans.
Barcelona will have to sell before they can buy, but remain confident that they can strike a deal with the Serie A side.

Dominic Raab: Government can't make apologies for Spain quarantine decision
Dominic Raab has defended the Government's decision to re-introduce quarantine measures on Spain at short notice.
Ministers announced on Saturday that holidaymakers who had not returned from Spain and its islands by midnight would be forced to self-isolate for 14 days.
The country had been on a list of "travel corridor" nations deemed safe to visit by Downing Street, but a recent surge in coronavirus cases has sparked fears of a second wave of the disease.
On Sunday, the Foreign Secretary defended the sudden reimposition of restrictions as a "real-time response" to a worrying spike in infections reported in the region.
He said the situation was then assessed yesterday afternoon "and we took the decision as swiftly as we could."
"We can't make apologies for doing so," he added.
"We must be able to take swift, decisive action, particularly in relation to localised, or internationally in relation to Spain or a particular country, where we see we must take action."
"Otherwise, we risk re-infection into the UK, potentially a second wave here and then another lockdown."
Transport secretary among Spain holidaymakers forced to quarantine
The decision was made after Spain recorded more than 900 new daily Covid-19 cases for two days running.
The Foreign Secretary acknowledged that many tourists had been left with no time to cancel or alter their plans.
"I understand it is disruptive for those going through this who are in Spain or have been considering going but we must be able to take swift, decisive action to protect the UK," he said.
"We've made such progress in getting the virus down and preventing the virus re-taking hold in the UK."
Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth condemned the Government for its "frankly shambolic" handling of the measure.
He said Downing Street's sudden decision had left holidaymakers "confused and distressed."
The Labour MP told Sophy Ridge: "I understand why they've made the decision but, of course, the way in which this decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic.
"There are holidaymakers in Spain at the moment confused and distressed, there are people about to go on holiday to Spain and the islands like Tenerife who are confused, and they don't know whether their employers will allow them to take two weeks" quarantine.
"The Government is just saying, "we hope that employers co-operate.""
"The way in which this decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic."
What does Spain being on quarantine list mean for holidaymakers?
He urged ministers to offer "clarity" on whether those who are asked to quarantine will receive financial support if their employers refuse to pay them during the quarantine period.
He added that clear information was also needed "for those holidaymakers who are currently in Spain who have properly saved up all year for their family holiday who are confused and distressed."
"The way in which this decision has been communicated is obviously causing anxiety," he stressed.
Mr Raab said no worker following the new guidance should be penalised by employers, including by being put onto sick pay.
He said: "We are changing the rules - the law is changed in relation to holidaymakers and travellers - and of course we expect employers to show those employees who will have to quarantine because of the law the flexibility they need.
"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they can't have penalties taken against them."
Covid-19 will permanently change the world's economy (opinion)
Virus screening is likely to become part of our life, just like security measures became ubiquitous after 9/11.
It is important to invest in the infrastructure necessary to detect future viral outbreaks.
This investment protects economies in case immunity to Covid-19 turns out to be temporary.
Many economies adopted versions of Germany's Kurzarbeit (short work) subsidy during the pandemic.
This policy keeps workers employed at reduced hours and pay, with the government compensating some of the shortfall in wages.
By keeping matches between firms and workers intact, the economy is better prepared for a quick recovery.
It is important to improve the implementation of these policies and make them a permanent part of our economic recovery tool kit.
Remote work is likely to become more common.
We had some evidence that working from home is at least as productive as working at the office.
However, many companies were reluctant to embrace remote work.
Now that many have tried it with good results, remote work might be here to stay.
The pandemic crisis has accelerated the pace of digital transformation, with further expansion in e-commerce and increases in the pace of adoption of telemedicine, videoconferencing, online teaching and fintech.
Companies with international supply chains are dealing with shortages and bottlenecks.
We are likely to see many of these companies reshore some of their production.
Unfortunately, this trend will not create many jobs because most of the production is likely to be automated.
Governments will be bigger after playing the role of insurer and investor of last resort during the crisis.
Public debt will balloon, creating financial challenges around the world.
The most important lesson from the Covid-19 pandemic is the importance of working together on problems that affect the entire human race.
We are much stronger united than divided.
Firefighters gain ground on Lassen County blazes
Firefighters are gaining ground against two wildfires that have burned more than 30000 acres in Lassen County, northeast of Sacramento.
The Gold fire, which started south of Adin, is 40% contained as it continues to threaten homes and ranches as well as agriculture, livestock and timber operations, Cal Fire officials said in an update Saturday morning.
After burning for four days, the fire has chewed through 21000 acres, destroyed seven homes and sent two firefighters to the hospital.
Overnight, firefighters took advantage of milder conditions to build and reinforce control lines.
But gusty winds and low humidity are expected through Saturday.
West of Susanville, a smaller fire known as the Hog fire has destroyed two structures and consumed about 10000 acres.
The fire settled down overnight as firefighters worked to mop up and strengthen control lines, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
By Saturday morning, it was 45% contained and had been burning for six days.
In the daytime heat, with temperatures above 90 degrees in the Susanville area, smoldering patches were at risk of flaring up.
While some residents are being allowed to return to their homes, some areas in both fire zones remain under mandatory evacuation orders.
The two firefighters injured in the Gold fire have been released from the hospital.
200-Plus Firefighters Respond To Karen Fire Burning In Jurupa Valley - CBS Los Angeles

Flat, Free Education For Indore Egg Seller Paras Raykar Whose Cart Was Overturned Allegedly Over Rs. 100 Bribe
Paras Raykar's cart carrying eggs was allegedly overturned Thursday by the civic officials in Indore.
Two days after the story of a 13-year-old egg seller's cart being overturned by civic officials went viral on social media, the Indore-based boy has found overwhelming support from people across the country, helping them recover from the losses and manage to start their business again.
The boy's family also claimed that politicians including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal have reached out to them and offered support.
The boy's family also received a flat and offer to take care of the educational expenses of the children in the family.
Paras Raykar's cart carrying eggs was allegedly overturned Thursday by the civic officials in Indore, where the administration has implemented the "left-right" rule for the staggered opening of shops amid the coronavirus pandemic.
A video in which the boy alleged that the officials had warned him in the morning to remove his cart or pay Rs 100 as bribe had gone viral on social media.
When he refused, the officials tipped his cart over, destroying all the eggs, the boy alleged.
The boy had also claimed that his daily sale has been down due to the pandemic and the loss of his stock will put additional financial burden on him, in the video.
Since Thursday, the boy's family has been overwhelmed with support from people across the country, many of them offering help in both cash and kind.
The family has also received help from locals.
While former chief minister Digvijaya Singh has offered financial support and help to get the children admitted in a college, BJP MLA from Indore, Ramesh Mendola, has assured to provide a house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to the child.
Indore Press Club has also provided ration and money to the boy.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's office and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also offered help.
"We are overwhelmed by the support from people across the country.
(BJP MLA) Ramesh Mendola has assured a flat under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.
He has also provided a cycle and Rs 2500.
Digvijaya Singh has provided Rs 10000 and assurance to look after the education of the two children.
Rahul Gandhi's office has also called and offered support.
A woman from Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called and offered help.
Jyothiraditya Scindia has also offered support," Paras's grandfather said.
UN says thousands of anti-Pakistan militants in Afghanistan
ISLAMABAD -- A UN report says more than 6000 Pakistani insurgents are hiding in Afghanistan, most belonging to the outlawed Pakistani Taliban group responsible for attacking Pakistani military and civilian targets.
The report released this week said the group, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), has linked up with the Afghan-based affiliate of the Islamic State group.
Some of TTP's members have even joined the IS affiliate, which has its headquarters in eastern Afghanistan.
The Afghan government did not respond Sunday to requests by The Associated Press for comment.
The report said IS in Afghanistan, known as IS in Khorasan province, has been hit hard by Afghan security forces as well as US and NATO forces, and even on occasion by the Afghan Taliban.
The report was prepared by the UN analytical and sanctions monitoring team, which tracks terrorist groups around the world.
The report estimated the membership of IS in Afghanistan at 2200, and while its leadership has been depleted, IS still counts among its leaders a Syrian national Abu Said Mohammad al-Khorasani.
The report also said the monitoring team had received information that two senior Islamic State commanders, Abu Qutaibah and Abu Hajar al-Iraqi, had recently arrived in Afghanistan from the Middle East.
"Although in territorial retreat, (the Islamic State) remains capable of carrying out high-profile attacks in various parts of the country, including Kabul.
It also aims to attract Taliban fighters who oppose the agreement with the United States," the report said, referring to a US peace deal signed with the Taliban in February.
That deal was struck to allow the US to end its 19-year involvement in Afghanistan, and calls on the Taliban to guarantee its territory will not be used by terrorist groups.
The deal is also expected to guarantee the Taliban's all-out participation in the fight against IS.
The second and perhaps most critical part of the agreement calls for talks between the Taliban and Kabul's political leadership.
Late Saturday, the US State Department issued a statement saying its peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was again shuttling through the region seeking to jump start those negotiations, which have been repeatedly postponed as both sides squabble over a prisoner release program.
The US-backed deal calls for the Afghan government to release 5000 Taliban prisoners and the Taliban to free 1000 government and military personnel as a so-called good will gesture ahead of talks.
Until now the government is refusing to release nearly 600 Taliban prisoners it calls high-profile criminals and has offered to free alternatives.
The Taliban have refused.
"The parties are closer than ever to the start of intra-Afghan negotiations, the key next step to ending Afghanistan's 40-year long war," said the US State Department statement.
"Although significant progress has been made on prisoner exchanges, the issue requires additional effort to fully resolve."
The Taliban's political spokesman earlier this week said it was ready to hold talks with Kabul's political leaders after the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha at the end of the month, providing the prisoner release is completed.
A big worry for Pakistan is the presence in Afghanistan of militants, particularly linked to the TTP or Jamaat-ul-Ahrar or Lashkar-e-Islam, as well as those with the Baluchistan Liberation Army, which has taken responsibility for high-profile attacks this month in the southern Sindh province as well as in southwestern Baluchistan Province.
Several Pakistan military personnel have been killed this month in southwestern Baluchistan province in battle with insurgents.
The TTP took responsibility for one of the most horrific attacks in Pakistan in 2014, when a Pakistani army school was attacked and 140 were killed.
Most were students, and some were as young as 5.
"The total number of Pakistani foreign terrorist fighters in Afghanistan, posing a threat to both countries, is estimated at between 6000 and 6500, most of them with TTP," the report said.
Coronavirus Travel Update: Which Countries Have Travel Restriction for Bulgarians Upon Entry
The number of countries imposing travel restrictions is growing. As of this week, the Czech Republic wants coronavirus tests for Bulgarian seasonal workers. Denmark allows Bulgarians on its territory only if they have an address registration there, an employment contract or a document certifying a business trip.
As of today, people who have visited Bulgaria and Romania in the last 14 days are subject to mandatory quarantine in Italy. In Finland, entry is only for a "valid reason."
Mandatory home quarantine in Austria, despite a negative PCR test. This is already required for those entering Germany. For the next 14 days, access to southern Romania was denied without good reason. And Greece has tightened measures even more along its land borders.
From Tuesday, those traveling by plane from Bulgaria to Greece will have to present to the Greek border authorities a negative result from a PCR test for coronavirus, performed up to 72 hours before their entry into our southern neighbor, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced.
They added that only passengers who have a certificate for such a test will be allowed in the country. It must be issued in English and contain the three names and numbers of the passenger's passport or identity card. The authorities in our southern neighbor will not accept certificates that do not meet these requirements
"Travelers should be tested in the laboratory by RT-PCR by taking secretions from the mouth or nose. Tests for coronavirus will be recognized if they are performed in national reference laboratories, national health laboratories or private laboratories that are accredited by the relevant national accreditation bodies (not necessarily specifically for COVID-19).
The measure does not apply to Greek citizens, citizens residing in Greece and travelers for significant professional reasons.
The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs also announced that on Tuesday, July 28, and Wednesday, July 29, passengers who did not have time to be tested before their trip will be tested by the competent Greek authorities upon arrival in Greece.
The requirement for citizens traveling by plane to Greece to fill in at least 24 hours in advance an electronic Passenger Location Form (PLF) generating a QR code, which they present to the Greek authorities upon entering the country, remains in force. More information is published on travel.gov.gr
At the moment there is no change in the requirements for crossing the land borders between Bulgaria and Greece. "Travelers to Greece across the land border, regardless of their citizenship, must also fill in an electronic passenger localization form (PLF) generating a QR code at least 24 hours before arrival," the Foreign Ministry explained.
The closure of the Ilinden, Kapitan Petko Voyvoda and Makaza checkpoints has increased traffic across the border near Petrich. There are no problems with the transition. There are no queues of trucks. All those waiting go to sea in Greece. Travelers wait about an hour and a half to cross the Tower.
Three of the points on the Bulgarian-Greek border are working. Only "Ilinden - Exohi" and this part of Ivaylovgrad are closed.
Tony Blair vows never to stop meddling in British politics despite severe Brexit backlash
Tony Blair has pledged not to stop intervening in UK politics, following severe backlash to his involvement in the Labour Party and anti-Brexit campaigning.
Mr Blair, who has been out of office for more than ten years, told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that he will "never" stop speaking out in British politics.
However, the controversial political figure acknowledged "a lot of people watching this might think I should stop talking about things."
Sophy Ridge told Mr Blair: "I always get the sense you can't wrench yourself away from politics.
"You are always publishing reports on coronavirus or coming up with arguments on Brexit.
"I just wonder if people think, why after ten years of being PM, are you still trying to be involved in politics?
"Isn't it time to take some time out, go around the golf course."
The former prime minister rejected this and vowed to stay around in UK politics as long as he can.
He said: "It's not something I want to do. A lot of people watching might think that's exactly what he should do and stop talking about things, but I care about the country."
"We are at a huge moment of change in the world and the institute I built works around the world.
"I know I've done something that previous prime ministers have not done but in the future I predict many more will try to do."
Earlier in the interview, Mr Blair said that the UK and EU could still land a deal on Brexit before the end of the year.
He said: "They could land a deal. But even the deal we land is going to be bad."
"It's essentially going to be good for Europe because it will allow easier trade in goods but very inhibiting for us on the issue of services."
The former Labour leader also told Sky News the UK is going to be living with COVID-19, not eliminating it, for the foreseeable future.
Tight Security Presence outside US Consulate in Chengdu, China
There was a tight security presence outside the US consulate in the city of Chengdu, China Sunday, as the American staff prepared to leave the premises.
Three moving trucks were seen entering the building compound, while uniformed and plainclothes police lined both sides of the street, which were lined with metal barriers.
The editor of China's Global Times tabloid tweeted that the US consulate in Chengdu was given 72 hours to close, or until 10 am (0200GMT) Monday, July 27.
China charged that some personnel at the Chengdu consulate were "conducting activities not in line with their identities."
Without giving any details, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Wang Wenbin said such activity had interfered in China's affairs and harmed its security interests.
China's order to close the consulate in Chengdu was issued Friday in retaliation for a US order to close the Chinese consulate in Houston, Texas.
Washington ordered China to close the Houston office "to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information."
As Chinese consulate closure in Houston took effect on Friday, a group of men who appeared to be US officials were seen breaking-in to the facility through a back door.
Wang said on Saturday that violated international and bilateral agreements and China would respond, without specifying of how.
The tit-for-tat closures further escalated the tensions between the two countries over issues from trade and industrial espionage to human rights.
Egypt begins registering data of voters abroad for senate elections
The National Election Authority (NEA) on Saturday began registering the data of voters aboard to begin casting their votes in the senate elections to be held on August 9 and 10, according to the NEA's official website.
Voters must register their data and the diplomatic mission affiliated to their residence abroad on the NEA's website from July 25 until July 31.
The NEA also published a video explaining the steps voters can take to cast their vote remotely via email, as part of precautions against the coronavirus pandemic.
The legal period of senate candidate electoral propaganda runs from July 26 until August 8, the NEA said.
Minister of Emigration and Egyptian Expatriates Affairs Nabila Makram called on Egyptian voters abroad to participate in the election as their constitutional right.
Egypt's House of Representatives on June 17 approved a law establishing a senate, which will function as an upper house of parliament.
The law passed with a two-thirds majority, with the objection of four MPs.
The Senate will consist of 300 members, 100 of whom are elected by a closed list system, 100 elected by an individual system, and 100 members appointed by the President of the Republic.
The term of membership in the Senate will be five years, starting from the date of its first meeting. The new assembly is to be elected during the sixty days preceding the end of its term.
India's PM to attend temple groundbreaking at disputed site
NEW DELHI (AP) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend a groundbreaking ceremony next month for a Hindu temple on a disputed site in northern India where a 16th century mosque was torn down by Hindu hard-liners in 1992, according to the trust overseeing the temple construction.
The ceremony is set for Aug. 5, a date organizers said was astrologically auspicious for Hindus but that also marks a year since the Indian Parliament revoked the semi-autonomous status of its only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir.
The symbolism was impossible to miss for both supporters and opponents of Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, whose manifesto had for decades included pledges to strip restive Kashmir's autonomy and to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram where the Mughal-era mosque once stood, a site in the city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh state that devotees <v>believe to be Ram's birthplace</v>.
Because the coronavirus is still rampaging across India, which has reported the world's third-highest caseload, the ceremony will be broadcast live on state television and the number of participants and spectators will be limited, according to Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or the World Hindu Organization, a Hindu nationalist group allied with the BJP.
The temple will serve as "an enduring and immortal beaming center of social harmony, national unity and integration and awakening of the feeling of Hindutva," or Hindu way of life, the organization's spokesperson Vinod Bansal said in a news release Saturday.
A century-long dispute over the site was resolved last year following the BJP's landslide election victory.
In November, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the temple trust, saying that Muslim petitions would be given five acres at an alternative site.
Hindus hard-liners have long contended that Mughal Muslim invaders built a mosque on top of a preexisting temple in the ancient city of Ayodya.
A December 1992 riot following the destruction of the mosque sparked communal violence in which about 2000 people were killed, mostly Muslims.
Meanwhile, the trial in the demolition court case continues to be heard in a special court.
An architect from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Modi's home state, has proposed a towering sandstone structure 161 feet (49 meters) high with five domes.
Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh's chief minister and a Hindu monk, requested that Ayodhya hold a special cleaning and purification ceremony and for all of the city's temples to light oil lamps ahead of Modi's visit, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.
Adityanath said the occasion marked the end of a "500-year struggle," PTI reported.
Police try new, less-lethal tools as protests continue
As violent clashes continue between law enforcement and protesters in Portland and around the country, debate is swirling around how police can cut back on lethal force.
Some companies are stepping up to offer new high-tech tools like remote handcuffs for police to use instead of the more dangerous options like pepper spray, rubber bullets and flash grenades.
Human rights group Amnesty International analyzed 500 videos from protests from May 26 through June 5 and found 125 incidents of excessive force across 40 states and the District of Columbia.
"We saw a misuse of tear gas, pepper spray, pepper balls, 40 millimeter impact rounds, basically every combination of less-lethal weapon being used in inappropriate ways," said Amnesty International weapons investigator Brian Castner.
Still, some insist that having options is important for avoiding the need for a firearm.
"All of these devices should be at hand for the cops to use other than deadly physical force being used by a firearm because it's the only profession in America where the citizens give you the right to take your life," said Corey Pegues, former New York Police Department Deputy Inspector.
One of the newest tools is called the Bola Wrap, a handheld device that shoots out an 8-foot Kevlar cord that wraps around a suspect.
There are Long Range Acoustic Devices, also known as sound canons, directed energy weapons that use lasers to heat a person's skin, new projectiles made from things like foam and chalk, stink bombs, and of course the Taser.
Shares of Axon, the company that makes the Taser, spiked more than 18%, reaching all-time highs when protests turned violent days after the police killing of George Floyd.
The market for less-lethal weapons is expected to reach $11.85 billion by 2023.
Watch the video to get a look at the new high-tech tools police are using for less-lethal force, how they're regulated, and what's at stake for the future of policing and the communities they serve.
Threats to Australian democracy are closer to home than China
But a series of recently passed or pending measures in the Commonwealth Parliament give rise to concerns about our own, home-grown authoritarianism.
They include a roll out of facial recognition technology, forcing technology companies to decrypt information held on their customers" computer systems, forcing technology companies to provide access to their customers" cloud-based information without notification to the owner of the information and extending ASIO's compulsory questioning powers.
These measures raise serious questions about the border between citizens and government, but the ASIO Bill is particularly worrying.
Unlike any of the other Five Eyes countries - United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand - in the wake of September 11, ASIO was given power to compulsorily question people for up to seven days in relation to terrorism offences.
While it might be accepted that the extreme violence associated with terrorism offences justifies extraordinary powers - extreme violence at least offers a bright line border around these extraordinary powers.
That certainly cannot be said about the "sweeping and vague" definitions used in this bill to trigger the compulsory questioning power: dealing with information which prejudices Australia's "political, military or economic relations with another country"; or activities in collaboration with a foreign power which are clandestine or deceptive and are "detrimental to Australia's interests."
It is hard to imagine more "sweeping and vague "national security" legislation" than this.
ASIO would be allowed to compulsorily question anyone about these things - not just suspected offenders.
This includes journalists, business people, university academics and staff, lawyers, citizens, residents and visitors.
ASIO would simply have to show the questioning would "substantially contribute to the collection of intelligence" about foreign interference, which seems to be the main target of the bill.
The person could then be questioned for up to 40 hours (not including breaks).
If the person refused to attend, they would be arrested.
Refusal to answer or giving false or misleading answers would carry a maximum five year sentence.
Rules that are fundamental in our legal systems - indeed protected by the constitution in the United States - are overturned by this bill.
People - including people already facing charges - will be compelled to provide evidence that may then be used to prosecute them.
They could have a lawyer present, but the lawyer would be confined to clarifying questions that were ambiguous or unclear.
The new bill transfers the decision to issue a questioning warrant from a judge to the Attorney-General.
As pointed out by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, this "departs from the trend for increased requirements for external authorisation in other Five Eyes jurisdictions."
It also breaches the separation of powers principle that courts scrutinise the actions of executive government.
The new bill also proposes to expand the questioning power to children who are at least 14 years old, but only to those engaged or likely to engage in activities prejudicial to the protection of Australia and people from politically motivated violence.
Even if our intelligence agencies were the best in the world, conferring a power to compulsorily question anyone about information which "prejudices Australia's economic relations with another country," or activities which are "detrimental to Australia's interests" is beyond the pale.
We stand alone.
No other Five Eyes country goes so far, not even for terrorism offences.
Genuinely liberal democracies guard against authoritarian measures.
The conduct of our security agencies in relation to the bugging of the East Timor parliament, the trials of Witness K and Bernard Collaery, the secret trial and imprisonment of a former intelligence officer, the recent search warrants executed on two journalists, and the prospect of charges against one of them in relation to stories on suspected murders by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan show why we should not be lowering our guard.
Leicester happy to hit target of European football says Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy
Jamie Vardy acknowledged his disappointment at missing out on Champions League football, but said Leicester City achieved their early-season objective of qualifying for Europe.
The Foxes were second in December and third when football restarted after lockdown, but they took just four points from their last five games to finish fifth in the Premier League.
A final-day win over Manchester United would have secured a top-four finish, but Brendan Rodgers" side suffered a 2-0 loss, which Vardy says was the most upsetting aspect.
"It was disappointing, more the way we've ended up losing the game," he said on Sky Sports at full-time.
"But we've said in the dressing room, we targeted behind closed doors to qualify for Europe and we've done that.
"We had the chance to qualify for the Champions League and that was even better, but we'll reflect on it and come back stronger next year.
"It's hard to take, but our main target was Europe and we've managed to do that."
While his team fell short, Vardy himself ended the season as the Premier League's top scorer at 33 years of age, scoring 23 times.
He paid tribute to his team-mates in receiving the award and said there are still plenty of miles left in him at the top level, despite his advancing age.
"I'm delighted, it's all about the team. I wouldn't have been in the position I was for the goals without them and I've put quite a few away.
"I'll have a rest for a bit now and come back for next season ready to go.
Fortunately I don't feel my age, my legs are still fine and touch wood I don't pick up many injuries, so it's about keeping on top of that and come back as strong as I can next year."
Home Secretary Priti Patel demands explanation from Twitter and Instagram over 'abhorrent' Wiley tweets
Priti Patel has demanded an explanation from Twitter and Instagram over the length of time it took to remove "abhorrent" posts made by Wiley.
Police are currently investigating a series of antisemitic comments posted on the Grime artist's social media accounts.
The Home Secretary tweeted on Sunday: "The antisemitic posts from Wiley are abhorrent.
"They should not have been able to remain on Twitter and Instagram for so long and I have asked them for a full explanation.
"Social media companies must act much faster to remove such appalling hatred from their platforms."
Twitter was accused of "ignoring antisemitism" as Wiley's tweets were still visible 12 hours after they were first posted.
A number of tweets have since been removed and the 41-year-old has been issued a seven-day ban by the site.
Twitter previously said Wiley's account had been temporarily locked "for violating our hateful conduct policy," while Facebook said there was "no place for hate speech on Instagram."
The Metropolitan Police said on Saturday: "The Met takes all reports of antisemitism extremely seriously. The relevant material is being assessed."
Meanwhile, Wiley's management company, A-List Management, "cut all ties" with the star.
The artist's now former manager, John Woolf, who is Jewish, wrote on Twitter: "Following Wiley's antisemitic tweets today we at @A_ListMGMT have cut all ties with him. There is no place in society for antisemitism."
He had earlier said he did not support or condone what Wiley posted but that he would speak to him privately and "help educate him."
However, in a video on Instagram, Wiley appeared to say it was him who had cut ties with his management.
Other MPs criticised Twitter for allowing the tweets to remain visible.
Labour MP Jess Phillips said on Saturday: "Just seen all the Wiley stuff. Why on earth have @Twitter left up such blatant antisemitism and hatred? It hits all the dangerous beats, Jews get things you don't get, they are in control, they think their better... This is dangerous stuff. Surely it should come down."
Fellow MP Neil Coyle added: "His management appear able to act quicker than @Twitter emphasising, once again, that legislation (including the Online Harms Bill) should ensure social media platforms are not used to spread hate."
John Mann, the government's independent adviser on antisemitism, said the tweets "demonstrated precisely why the law needs changing to hold them to reasonable account."
Meanwhile, the Campaign Against Antisemitism asked police to investigate Wiley's content and called on his social media accounts to be shut down "to prevent further outpouring of anti-Jewish venom."
Wiley, known as the Godfather of Grime and whose real name is Richard Cowie, received an MBE for services to music in 2018.
